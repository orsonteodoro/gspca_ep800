gspca_ep800
===========

This is a linux driver for the Endpoints EP800/SE402/SE401* driver.  This driver is based on Jeroen B. Vreeken 
EP800 driver and is simply adapted to the newer GSPCA driver framework.

The driver is released under the terms of the GPL Version 2 (or newer).

Linux Kernel 3.4.x is currently supported.

*SE401 is supported only for newer firmware.

Changes
-------
20160125 Compiled successfully against Kernel 4.1.2.  Still needs testing.  Code updates were about fixing missing structs.  No features were lost or gain.  Makefile was added to compile driver seperately.
